# Notes for Network Analysis

University of Mannheim

2019 Fall Semester

## Introduction

Because there are too many definitions, math formulas and algorithms in the course *Network Analysis*,  I finally decide to organize these knowledge in this new repository. 

I think it's less meaningful to copy the definitions from the slides to github, so this repository will mostly include the related algorithms, which are also the most confusing for me. lol

Again, if you are from **Tsinghua SEM** and plan to exchange in **the University of Mannheim** and happen to be interested in *Network Analysis*, you can go through this repository quickly and see whether this course is what you want. Welcome to contact me if you have further questions! 

This repository may be updated less often, because the final exam seems to be far far away~~
